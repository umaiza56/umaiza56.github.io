        <h3>Tkinter</h3>
        <p>
            Python has a lot of GUI frameworks, but Tkinter is the only framework that’s built into the Python standard
            library. Tkinter has several strengths.
            It’s cross-platform, so the same code works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Visual elements are rendered using
            native operating system elements,
            so applications built with Tkinter look like they belong on the platform where they’re run. Although Tkinter
            is considered the de-facto Python GUI
            framework, it’s not without criticism.

            <h3> Python GUI</h3>
            <p>
                Python offers multiple options for developing
                GUI (Graphical User Interface). Out of all the
                GUI methods, tkinter is the most commonly used method.
                It is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit
                shipped with Python. Python with tkinter is the fastest
                and easiest way to create the GUI applications.
                Creating a GUI using tkinter is an easy task.
